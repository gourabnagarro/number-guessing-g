# Number Guessing Game

## Overview
This project is a console-based Number Guessing Game created using Python, developed with the assistance of GitHub Copilot. The game randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player must guess the number. Feedback is provided for each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game tracks the number of attempts and includes additional features such as hint provision, scoring, and high score tracking.

## Features
- **Random Number Generation**: Generates a random number between 1 and 100 (or within a user-specified range).
- **User Input**: Prompts the user to guess the number.
- **Feedback**: Provides feedback for each guess.
- **Attempt Tracking**: Keeps track of the number of attempts made by the player.
- **Play Again Option**: Allows the player to play the game again after guessing the correct number.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the user enters valid numeric input.
- **Enhanced Features**:
  - Allows the player to set the range for the random number.
  - Implements a scoring system.
  - Provides hints after a certain number of attempts.
  - Stores high scores in a file and displays them.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- GitHub Copilot (for development assistance)

## How to Play
1. **Initialization**: The game welcomes the player and asks for the range of numbers.
2. **Guessing**: The player is prompted to guess the number within the specified range.
3. **Feedback**: Feedback is provided for each guess - too high, too low, or correct.
4. **Hints**: Hints are provided after the player crosses half of the attempts of the range.
5. **Scoring**: The score is calculated based on the number of attempts.
6. **Play Again**: After guessing the correct number, the player can choose to play again.
7. **High Scores**: High scores are saved in a JSON file and displayed upon exiting the game.

## GitHub Copilot Usage


### Code Completion and Context
- **Description**: While writing the Number Guessing Game, GitHub Copilot can be used to provide code suggestions based on the current context. For example, when writing a function to generate a random number, GitHub Copilot can suggest the appropriate code to accomplish this task.
- **Example Usage**: When I began writing the `generate_random_number` function, GitHub Copilot suggested the correct method for generating a random number within a given range.

### Chat Interface
- **Description**: The chat interface in GitHub Copilot can be used to ask for help with specific coding problems or to generate entire code snippets. It's similar to having a conversation with ChatGPT where you can describe your problem, and GitHub Copilot will assist you.
- **Example Usage**: I used the chat interface to identify issues with input validation and to ensure that the user enters a valid number. By describing my problem in the chat, GitHub Copilot provided suggestions and solutions that helped me resolve the issue efficiently.

### Ghost Text and Code Generation
- **Description**: By writing comments or placeholders in the code (known as ghost text), GitHub Copilot generates the corresponding code. This feature helps in quickly generating boilerplate code and completing repetitive tasks.
- **Example Usage**: I wrote a comment indicating that I needed a function to provide feedback for each guess. GitHub Copilot generated the necessary code based on this comment, which saved time and improved my coding efficiency.

### Inline Chat
- **Description**: GitHub Copilot’s inline chat can be used to discuss code snippets, get real-time assistance, and refine your code. It is a useful feature for getting immediate help and feedback while coding.
- **Example Usage**: I used the inline chat to refine the scoring system. By sharing code snippets and discussing different approaches in real-time, I enhanced the quality of the final implementation.

## Best Practices and Dos and Don’ts

### Dos
1. Use GitHub Copilot for generating boilerplate code and repetitive tasks.
2. Review and understand the generated code before using it.
3. Use comments to guide GitHub Copilot in generating the desired code.

### Don’ts
1. Do not blindly accept all code suggestions without reviewing them.
2. Avoid using generated code that is not understood.
3. Do not rely solely on GitHub Copilot for critical code sections.

## Security and Privacy Considerations
- **Risks**: Exposing sensitive information like authentication tokens or API keys.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data can lead to security breaches.
- **Preventive Measures**:
  1. Never enable public code suggestions without client approval.
  2. Regularly review code for sensitive information.
  3. Use environment variables to manage secrets.
